Computes the phases of the classical orders. Need to know the amplitudes of the single parameters. It works by computing the fluxes through non-trivial loops in the lattice. 
Need to specify the loop through the "A" list and the value of the spins in the loop through the "Spins" list.

Works and computes all the phases for the classical orders. Maybe could be made more efficient by computing directly all the phases but is not actually necessary.

Now it computes all phases at once for the specified ansatz. Reproduces results precedently obtained probably by chance.
